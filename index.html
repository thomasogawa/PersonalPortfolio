        <h2 class = "FAQs" id = "FAQs">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>This section contains questions and answers I would likely be asked in interviews based on past experience and research.</p>
        <ul class = "GetRidOfDots">
            <li>
                <h3>Could you tell me a little bit about yourself?</h3>
                <p>Of course! Growing up I was also a very curious and math came easier to me than other academic subjects, but I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do for work. Then in an Introduction to Computer Science course my first semester in college I found the field I wanted to work in and declared as CS major that semester. A few years later as a fourth-year I got my first CS related job as an IT Intern and upon graduating I recieved a full-time offer to assist in implementing a new ERP System. Now that the project has finished I am looking for the next steps in my career.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Why are you looking for a new position?</h3>
                <p>While I enjoy my current company and co-workers, both my manager and I believe it would be better for my career long-term to move to a different company.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is something you enjoy about your current job?</h3>
                <p>Something I enjoy in my current work is that satisfactory feeling when I finish a project and see it in production. It is a very rewarding feeling to see my work in action.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Where do you see yourself in the future?</h3>
                <p> I see myself working at a small-midsize company around SoCal. However, I understand you have limited control in your life so I'm always open to just "go with the flow" and see where I end up. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What are you looking for your next position?</h3>
                <p> I'm looking for a long-term position where I can both my career and as a person. Also the people, I think I have been very fortunate to have many friendly and supportive co-workers/managers throughout my work career and I definitely would like to keep that trend going</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What are your hobbies?</h3>
                <p> During my free-time I enjoy playing in a weekly adult soccer league, exploring the outdoors, playing games, or just simply hanging out with friends.</p>
